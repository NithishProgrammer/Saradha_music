	           <p>I found a love, for me<br>
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead<br>
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet<br>
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
<br><br>
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love<br>
Not knowing what it was<br>
I will not give you up this time<br>
But darling, just kiss me slow<br>
Your heart is all I own<br>
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
<br><br>
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark<br>
With you between my arms<br>
Barefoot on the grass<br>
Listening to our favourite song<br>
When you said you looked a mess<br>
I whispered underneath my breath<br>
But you heard it<br>
Darling, you look perfect tonight
<br><br>
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know<br>
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home<br>
I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets<br>
To carry love, to carry children of our own
<br><br>
We are still kids, but we're so in love<br>
Fighting against all odds<br>
I know we'll be alright this time<br>
Darling, just hold my hand<br>
Be my girl, I'll be your man<br>
I see my future in your eyes
<br><br>
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark<br>
With you between my arms<br>
Barefoot on the grass<br>
Listening to our favorite song<br>
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful<br>
I don't deserve this<br>
Darling, you look perfect tonight
<br><br>
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark<br>
With you between my arms<br>
Barefoot on the grass<br>
Listening to our favorite song<br>
I have faith in what I see<br>
Now I know I have met an angel in person<br>
And she looks perfect
<br><br>
I don't deserve this<br>
You look perfect tonight</p>
