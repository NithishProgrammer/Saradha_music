	           <p>We're a long way from home<br>
Haven't seen you in so long<br>
But it all came back in one moment<br>
And the year started cold<br>
But I didn't notice at all<br>
And when we found there's a room we're both in<br><br>

We get Chinese food in small white boxes<br>
Live the life we saw in Friends<br>
Your room, it barely fits the mattress<br>
Wake up, leave for work again<br>
The wind, it seems to blow right through us<br>
Down jackets are the trend<br>
The rush, we're rushing deep into love<br><br>

English girl in an American town<br>
No elevator to the fifth floor, I'll<br>
Ring on the buzzer then you'll be right down<br>
I wish time would freeze<br>
Dungarees over the hoodie, we're out<br>
Feet are three feet off the ground<br>
Lost in love and we don't wanna be found<br>
It's just you and me<br>
My English girl in an American town<br>
In an American town<br><br>

Days come and go<br>
But it ends, windows closed<br>
And the scent of your perfume's on me<br>
You're useless with your phone<br>
Electric when one-on-one<br>
I thought I would be more nervous, darlin'<br><br>

We watch comedies and miss the endings<br>
Conversations till the dawn<br>
And your changin' tide, we push against it<br>
Challenge meanings in the songs<br>
And head out without a reservation<br>
Drinkin' out of paper bags<br>
And wasting time is time not wasted<br><br>

With my English girl in an American town<br>
No elevator to the fifth floor, I'll<br>
Ring on the buzzer then you'll be right down<br>
I wish time would freeze<br>
Dungarees over the hoodie, we're out<br>
Feet are three feet off the ground<br>
Lost in love and we don't wanna be found<br>
It's just you and me<br>
My English girl in an American town<br><br>

And when our eyes are closed together, I can't explain<br>
How the scent of your perfume takes me to a higher place<br>
We can watch it unfold or we can change how it takes<br>
And we build when it breaks down <br>

We drink Moscow Mules and steal the cups<br>
From, mostly, the Bowery Bar<br>
What a perfect day to fall in love on<br>
What a way to make a start
It appears when you think all is lost, then<br>
You don't remember when it started, never have to pretend<br><br>

With my English girl in an American town<br>
No elevator to the fifth floor, I'll<br>
Ring on the buzzer then you'll be right down<br>
I wish time would freeze<br>
Dungarees over the hoodie, we're out<br>
Feet are three feet off the ground<br>
Lost in love and we don't wanna be found<br>
It's just you and me<br><br>

English girl in an American town<br>
No elevator to the fifth floor, I'll<br>
Ring on the buzzer then you'll be right down<br>
I wish time would freeze<br>
Dungarees over the hoodie, we're out<br>
Feet are three feet off the ground<br>
Lost in love and we don't wanna be found<br>
It's just you and me<br>
My English girl in an American town</p>
